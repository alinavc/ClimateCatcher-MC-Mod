Bring your current weather to Minecraft for a more realistic experience! "User Weather" is designed to enhance one's gaming experience by utilizing the user's location to fetch real-time weather data from Open-Meteo's weather API. The mod then replicates the user's weather within Minecraft. 

For example, if it is snowing in the user's area, it will be snowing in game! 

Playable solo with user's location, or with friends utilizing the host's location.
